## Code examples

### [Find the unique number](https://www.codewars.com/kata/585d7d5adb20cf33cb000235)

There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!
```javascript
findUniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) === 2
findUniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) === 0.55
```
Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains more than 3 numbers.

The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.

#### Solution:

```javascript
function findUniq(arr) {
  for (var i = 1; i <= arr.length; i++){
    if (arr[i - 1] != arr[i] && arr[i - 1] === arr[i + 1]){
      return arr[i];
    }
    if (arr[i - 1] != arr[i] && arr[i - 1] != arr[i + 1]){
      return arr[i - 1];
    }
    if (arr[i - 1] === arr [i] && arr[i - 1] != arr[i + 1]){
      return arr[i + 1];
    }
  } 
}
```
